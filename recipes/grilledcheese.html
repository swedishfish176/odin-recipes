        <h2>A simple childhood comfort food</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>2 slices</em> favorite bread. I prefer a thick Texas toast.</li>
                <li><em>2 slices</em> favorite cheese. A combination can work wonderfully. Gouda and cheddar are my go-to.</li>
                <li><em>1 tbs</em> butter</li> 
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat. Butter both slices of bread and assemble sandwich with cheese between bread slices and buttered sides on the outside.</li>
                <li>Place sandwich into warmed pan. Let sit until golden brown, flip and repeat.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat, cut at a diagonal and enjoy! Serve with tomato soup for best experience.</li>
            </ol>
