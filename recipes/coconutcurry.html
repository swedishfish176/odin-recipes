        <h3>A delicious, creamy, slightly sweet and unforgetable coconut curry</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>1</em> large chicken breast</li>
            <li><em>2 tbs</em> mild red curry paste</li>
            <li><em>2 tbs</em> dark soy sauce</li>
            <li><em>1 can</em> coconut milk</li>
            <li><em>1</em> lime</li>
            <li><em>1 tbs</em> brown sugar</li>
            <li><em>1 cup</em> whatever vegetables you wish to add</li>
            <li><em>2 generations</em> family members who know how to cook</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first, and arguably most important step is to have 2 generations of solid
                cooks in your family. With this, you should have learned how to measure with your
                heart and your eyes, rather than a measuring spoon.
            </li>
            <li>To begin cooking this recipe, you will first need to cut your chicken breasts and
                tenderize them with your favorite method. I'm partial to the corn starch method.
            </li>
            <li>Once your chicken is tender, it's time to cook. Heat 1 tbs vegetable oil over high
                heat, cook chicken until golden brown and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>Remove your chicken from the heat, reserving any oil and chicken bits. Remove from
                heat and add curry paste to oil, stirring constantly until fragrant. Return to heat
                and add coconut milk and soy sauce.
            </li>
            <li>This is the part where those cooking skills will come in handy. Add whatever your
                little heart desires. I usually add some brown sugar, carrots, peppers and potatoes.
                Once veggies are soft, add chicken into mixture. Remove from heat and add lime juice.
                It's important to add the lime when the dish is removed from the heat because otherwise
                the flavor will disappear completely with the heat. Serve over rice or rice noodles. 
            </li>
        </ol>
